# Prediction-TablePL
Premier League Predictor

Hi I'm new here and new to Javascript. I need a little help with this project that im doing for leisure. 

The table is set up however I would like an output to the prediction column from the matched regex in the if statement. it prints to the console and works, however i am unsure of how to output the results to the prediction column. i have played around with innerHTML but to no avail. 

any help or direction is much appreciated.

thanks
